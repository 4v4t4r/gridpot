\b0\fs24 \cf0 GridLAB-D\'99 is a new power distribution system simulation and analysis tool that provides valuable information to users who design and operate distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the latest energy technologies. It incorporates the most advanced modeling techniques, with high-performance algorithms to deliver the best in end-use modeling. GridLAB-D\'99 is coupled with distribution automation models and software integration tools for users of many power system analysis tools.\
GridLAB-D\'99 was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with industry and academia. Version 3.1 was released in fall 2014.\
